## About the Trivia Game (Timed Questions):

* The game shows only one question until the player answers it or if their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, a congratulation screen is shown for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, the next question is displayed.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

  If the player runs out of time or chooses the wrong answer, the correct answer will be displayed on screen. After a few seconds, next question is displayed on screen.

* On the final screen, the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page) are displayed.
